# README

FYI: For this `content/` directory, you can use either `.md` or `.mdx` files.

Currently, I'm mainly using `.md` since all my current pages are static and I have no jsx components,
and Neovim is also a bit friendlier with my `.md` files. For some reason, Neovim doesn't quite recognize
the `.mdx` files (despite installing the mdx language server), so I'm using the `.md` extension for now.

Whatever the name of the file, it becomes the slug of the page.
