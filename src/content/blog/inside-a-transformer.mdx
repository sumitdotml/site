## On residual stream as a communication channel

Residual stream?

![residual stream image taken from Anthropic](../../assets/blog/inside-a-transformer/residual-stream.png)

<i>[image source](#footnote-1)</i>

Lots about transformer layers (or blocks) & how information flows through them like a 'stream', as if different students in a class were given a topic to write an essay about on a long whiteboard & each student writes something new + reads what was written before

Matters mainly for 'reading' and 'writing': reading the previous layers' outputs, and writing one's output (which also happens to be the output from that nth layer added to the previous layers' outputs)

block 0 -> output -> fed to block 1 -> output (enriched with its own + block 0's info) -> fed to block 3....

this is a residual stream

reading = mainly `Q @ K^T`

writing = `x = x + attn_output`

## Inside the attention sub-layer: the mechanics

> `Note on sub_layer`: I believe this is the term the original Transformer uses to call its said block's primary sections. For instance, the encoder has 2 sub-layers: the multihead self-attention (MHA) layer and the the FFN (or MLP) layer.

I used to understand the steps involved in the attention sub-layer, but never really got around to understanding the "how" and "why" of it.

My knowledge of the MHA mechanism, until I went deep into this, was mostly the following steps:

```python
# assumptions
batch = 1
seqlen = 3
d_model = 32
d_head = 8
assert d_model % d_head == 0
heads = d_model // d_head
```

1\. Initialize the weights for the incoming input `x` (input = also understood as the residual stream up till that point)

```python
# assuming this already has the embeddings + positional encodings
x = torch.randn(batch, seqlen, d_model)
print(x.shape) # [1, 3, 32]

W_Q = torch.randn(d_model, d_model) # [32, 32]
W_K = torch.randn(d_model, d_model) # [32, 32]
W_V = torch.randn(d_model, d_model) # [32, 32]
W_O = torch.randn(d_model, d_model) # [32, 32]
```

2\. Compute the query, key, and value vectors and split them into heads.

```python
q = (x.__matmul__(W_Q)).view(batch, seqlen, heads, d_head).transpose(1, 2)
k = (x.__matmul__(W_K)).view(batch, seqlen, heads, d_head).transpose(1, 2)
v = (x.__matmul__(W_V)).view(batch, seqlen, heads, d_head).transpose(1, 2)
q.shape, k.shape, v.shape # [1, 4, 3, 8], [1, 4, 3, 8], [1, 4, 3, 8]
```

3\. Compute the attention scores

```python
attn_scores = q.__matmul__(torch.transpose(k, -2, -1))
attn_scores.shape # [1, 4, 3, 3]
```

> mask should also be applied in case of an attention inside the decoder, omitting for now (sample masking is done later here)

4\. Compute the attention weights

```python
attn_weights = torch.softmax(attn_scores / d_head ** 0.5, dim=-1)
attn_weights.shape # [1, 4, 3, 3]
```

5\. Compute the attended values

```python
attended_vals = attn_weights.__matmul__(v)
attended_vals.shape # [1, 4, 3, 8]
```

6\. Combine the split heads back into the original dimension

```python
output_heads_combined = attended_vals.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch, seqlen, d_model)
output_heads_combined.shape # [1, 3, 32]
```

7\. Compute the output projection

```python
output_proj = output_heads_combined.__matmul__(W_O)
output_proj.shape # [1, 3, 32]
```

But what is the intuition behind these steps? What is the best way of understanding the "how" and "why" of these steps? A few specific <b id="questions">questions</b>:

- What is the attention weight trying to tell us?
- There are batches of tokens that are being processed in parallel to get the output (input + output_proj, i.e., the updated "residual stream") from the MHA sub-layer of the transformer. How do I exactly visualize this? What happens sequentially? What happens in parallel?
- Why do we need the output projection? What is the intuition behind it?

### Trying to gain some deeper intuition

The Anthropic paper<FootnoteRef id="1" /> suggests that we break down the MHA sub-layer into 2 "circuits": the QK circuit and the OV circuit.

The following is a set of calculations that I did (once again), step-by-step, to gain some deeper intuition.

1\. Initializing some initial initializables

For this, I will assume the input is: "The cat sat". I will also assume the `d_model = 8`, and `d_q[-1] = 4`.

```python
torch.manual_seed(42)
seqlen = 3 # because the input is "The cat sat"
attn_scores = torch.randn(seqlen, seqlen) # randomly initializing for the sake of quick testing
d_hidden = 8 # aka d_model
q_last_layer = 4 # aka d_q[-1]
```

2\. Masking, softmaxing, and getting the attention weights (not going to do head splitting here for the sake of simplicity)

```python
upper_triangular = torch.triu(torch.ones_like(attn_scores), 1)
mask_bool = upper_triangular.bool()[:, :]
attn_scores_w_causal_mask = torch.masked_fill(attn_scores, mask_bool, value=torch.tensor(float("-inf")))
attn_w = torch.softmax(attn_scores_w_causal_mask / q_last_layer ** 0.5, -1)
attn_scores_w_causal_mask, attn_scores, attn_w
```

This gives us:

```python
# attn_scores_w_causal_mask
tensor([[ 0.3367,    -inf,    -inf],
         [ 0.2303, -1.1229,    -inf],
         [ 2.2082, -0.6380,  0.4617]]),

 # attn_scores
 tensor([[ 0.3367,  0.1288,  0.2345],
         [ 0.2303, -1.1229, -0.1863],
         [ 2.2082, -0.6380,  0.4617]]),

 # attn_w
 tensor([[1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],
         [0.6630, 0.3370, 0.0000],
         [0.6029, 0.1453, 0.2518]])
```

The following are assumed to be the attention scores, attention scores (with masking), and attention weights for the input "The cat sat".

```python
(tensor([[ 0.3367,    -inf,    -inf],
         [ 0.2303, -1.1229,    -inf],
         [ 2.2082, -0.6380,  0.4617]]),

 tensor([[ 0.3367,  0.1288,  0.2345],
         [ 0.2303, -1.1229, -0.1863],
         [ 2.2082, -0.6380,  0.4617]]),

 tensor([[1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],
         [0.6630, 0.3370, 0.0000],
         [0.6029, 0.1453, 0.2518]]))
```

Looking at the 3x3 attention weights matrix, I can picture this as:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & \text{The} & \text{cat} & \text{sat} \\[0.5em]
\hline \\[0.05em]
\text{The} & 1.0000 & 0.0000 & 0.0000 \\[0.5em]
\text{cat} & 0.6630 & 0.3370 & 0.0000 \\[0.5em]
\text{sat} & 0.6029 & 0.1453 & 0.2518
\end{array}
$$

<span id="intuition-on-attention-weights">Here, I can think of it like this:</span>

1. to understand "cat", how much will I have to look at the token "the"? --> exactly 1.000, so strong relevance for this computation.
2. to understand "sat", how much will I have to look at the token "the"? --> 0.6029, so a pretty solid relevance for this computation.
3. to understand "sat", how much will I have to look at the token "cat"? --> 0.1453, so an okay-ish relevance, not as strong as the one just before.

3\. Computing the attended values

```python
# assuming:
X_IN = torch.randn(seqlen, d_hidden) # [3, 8]
W_V_ = torch.randn(d_hidden, d_hidden)
V = X_IN.__matmul__(W_V_)
W_O_ = torch.randn(d_hidden, d_hidden)
ATTENDED = attn_w.__matmul__(V)
print(f"""W_V: {W_V_.shape} # [8, 8]
{W_V_}

V: {V.shape} # [3, 8]
{V}

attended weights: {ATTENDED.shape} # [3, 8]
{ATTENDED}
""")

# which gives us something like:
W_V: torch.Size([8, 8])
tensor([[ 0.0349,  0.3211,  1.5736, -0.8455,  1.3123,  0.6872, -1.0892, -0.3553],
        [-1.4181,  0.8963,  0.0499,  2.2667,  1.1790, -0.4345, -1.3864, -1.2862],
        [-0.8371, -0.9224,  1.8113,  0.1606,  0.3672,  0.1754,  1.3852, -0.4459],
        [-1.2024,  0.7078, -1.0759,  0.5357,  1.1754,  0.5612, -0.4527, -0.7718],
        [ 0.1453,  0.2311,  0.0087, -0.1423,  0.1971, -1.1441,  0.3383,  1.6992],
        [ 2.8140,  0.3598, -0.0898,  0.4584, -0.5644,  1.0563, -1.4692,  1.4332],
        [ 0.7281, -0.7106, -0.6021,  0.9604,  0.4048, -1.3543, -0.4976,  0.4747],
        [-0.1976,  1.2683,  1.2243,  0.0981,  1.7423, -1.3527,  0.2191,  0.5526]])

V: torch.Size([3, 8])
tensor([[-3.3538, -2.6614,  5.1813, -0.1024,  0.1555, -0.1970, -0.2466, -2.8980],
        [-0.4393,  1.2727,  0.4840, -3.8536, -1.8261,  5.3907,  0.3668, -2.1857],
        [-0.3070, -0.7861,  2.5214, -1.5471, -1.1485,  1.0364,  2.6574, -0.5662]])

attended weights: torch.Size([3, 8])
tensor([[-3.3538, -2.6614,  5.1813, -0.1024,  0.1555, -0.1970, -0.2466, -2.8980],
        [-2.3715, -1.3356,  3.5982, -1.3666, -0.5123,  1.6862, -0.0399, -2.6579],
        [-2.1632, -1.6177,  3.8292, -1.0111, -0.4607,  0.9254,  0.5737, -2.2074]])
```

4\. Computing the output projection

```python
OUTPUT_PROJECTION = ATTENDED.__matmul__(W_O_)
print(f"""{OUTPUT_PROJECTION.shape}
{OUTPUT_PROJECTION}""")

# which gives us something like:
torch.Size([3, 8])
tensor([[ 10.8347,  -4.9027,   7.4389,  -2.5553,   9.3776,  -2.1711, -14.9518,
          -5.0850],
        [  8.7450,  -3.9095,   3.6260,  -2.4063,   5.4063,  -1.0348, -11.8651,
          -2.1552],
        [  9.2331,  -4.1688,   2.8769,  -2.0400,   4.9977,  -1.7839, -11.5206,
          -2.4551]])
```

5\. Combining the attended values and the output projection for the updated `residual stream`

```python
residual_stream = X_IN + OUTPUT_PROJECTION
# this is bascially:
#   x_in + attended_val @ W_O {here, x_in = (enbeddings + pos_encodings), and attended_val @ W_O = output_projection}
# = x_in + (attention_weights @ V) @ W_O
# = x_in + ((Q @ K.T) @ (x_in @ W_V) @ W_O) {simplifying the attn weights a little here, softmax and being divide by d_k ** 0.5 are omitted}
residual_stream.shape, residual_stream

# which gives us something like:
(torch.Size([3, 8]),
 tensor([[ 12.7616,  -3.4154,   8.3396,  -4.6608,  10.0561,  -3.4056, -14.9948,
           -6.6897],
         [  9.1009,  -4.5961,   3.1327,  -2.1649,   4.2954,  -0.9433, -14.1820,
           -2.3720],
         [  8.9234,  -4.5645,   3.6803,  -2.6616,   4.4057,  -1.8470, -12.3491,
           -2.1242]]))
```

and that's the output from the MHA sub-layer of the transformer.

### A little more intuition on what this means

For, say, the word "sat" (3rd word in the sequence):

```
W_sat = residual_stream[2]
```

This is:

```
residual["sat"] aka residual[2]
= x_in["sat"] + attended_val["sat"] @ W_O
```

Let's assume our attention weight matrix was:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & \text{The} & \text{cat} & \text{sat} \\[0.5em]
\hline \\[0.05em]
\text{The} & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\[0.5em]
\text{cat} & 0.74 & 0.26 & 0.00 \\[0.5em]
\text{sat} & 0.20 & 0.50 & 0.30
\end{array}
$$

This means:

```python
attention_weights["sat"] = [0,20, 0.50, 0.30]
```

So, `residual["sat"]` is:

```
=> x_in["sat"] + (attention_weights["sat"] @ V) @ W_O
=> x_in["sat"] + ([0.2, 0.5, 0.3] @ [V_The, V_cat, V_sat]) @ W_O
=> x_in["sat"] + (0.2 * V_The + 0.5 * V_cat + 0.3 * V_sat) @ W_O
=> x_in["sat"] + (0.2 * x_in["the"] + 0.5 * x_in["cat"] + 0.3 * x_in["sat"]) @ W_O
```

Hence `W_sat` is:

```
x_in["sat"] + (0.2 * x_in["the"] + 0.5 * x_in["cat"] + 0.3 * x_in["sat"]) @ W_O
```

### So basically...

We can divide this process into 2 parts:

1. the QK circuit
2. the OV circuit

```
# the QK circuit:
Q @ K.T
=> (x @ W_Q) @ (x @ W_K).T

# the OV circuit:
(attention_weight @ V) @ W_O
=> (attention_weight @ (x @ W_V) @ W_O)
=> (attention_weight @ x) @ (W_V @ W_O)
```

Why talk about `W_OV = W_V @ W_O`? => For analysis and interpretability

Instead of thinking "first we transform by `W_V`, then later by `W_O`," we can think: "This attention head applies a single combined transformation `W_OV` to move information."

### Update on the [questions](#questions) I asked myself earlier

<ol>
  <li>What is the attention weight trying to tell us? <br />
  => <a href="#intuition-on-attention-weights">I know now</a> how to think about it.</li>

  <li>There are batches of tokens that are being processed in parallel to get the output (input + output_proj, i.e., the updated "residual stream") from the MHA sub-layer of the transformer. How do I exactly visualize this? What happens sequentially? What happens in parallel? <br />
  => Need to get my head around this. I'm sure this is much simpler than I'm making it out to be. <mark>Will update this soon.</mark></li>

  <li>Why do we need the output projection? What is the intuition behind it? <br />
  => This is basically how much to move the information forward based on the attention weights. <mark>Will update more details on this to come.</mark></li>
</ol>

> Still lots of questions to answer. Will update this as I go along.
