			"Most NLP research focuses on English and a handful of high-resource languages, but when I look at the AI status quo in my own country, I see a gap that needs to be filled, and as somebody privileged enough to have access to more education and resources than many, I feel like it's only right that I do my part. I'm particularly fascinated by how we can leverage recent AI breakthroughs to build better technologies for low-resource languages (like the languages of my own country) without massive training data. Time will tell, but I believe lots could be achieved through better cross-lingual transfer, smarter approaches to limited data, and systems that respect linguistic diversity. I do not believe creating synthetic data (like we usually do for high-resource languages) is a way, however, as this will most likely cause <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09833' target='_blank'>translationese</a> effects.",

			<h3>Preface</h3>
			<p>
				I'll add more stuff here later since I'm still migrating my site, but
				thanks for checking in! I go into some ramblings and random tangents
				about myself on my <Link
					href="/about"
					style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold);">about page</Link
				>, so if you want to read a little bit about me, that's a good place.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, I'm particularly interested in LLMs, multilingual models, and
				low-resource language research.<FootnoteRef id="1" />
			</p>
			<h3>Looking for Mentorship</h3>
			<p>
				I'm actively looking for mentorship in ML research! I'm particularly
				interested in LLM training, inference optimization, fine-tuning, and
				multilingual/low-resource language research: including but not limited
				to dataset curation, tokenization strategies, cross-lingual transfer,
				and model adaptation for underrepresented languages. Now with that being
				said, I'm genuinely open to exploring other areas of deep learning if
				the problems are compelling and the learning opportunity is strong
				(which might be pretty much every time if you're doing something
				interesting). I'm still figuring out what I don't know right now, which
				is exactly why I want to work alongside someone doing real research.
			</p>
			<p>
				My battle-tested method to learn has always been to put myself under
				immense pressure from where the only option is to survive via quick
				learning and adaptation. I love learning by doing: working on real
				problems, asking questions, being wrong, and building up intuition
				alongside someone who knows what they're doing. Therefore, if you're
				working on interesting problems and think having someone curious and
				motivated alongside you could be mutually valuable, I'd love to chat.
				All I ask for is the right environment to learn and contribute; nothing
				more. <Link

			<h3>Hmm... what else?</h3>
			<p>
				You can also check out my <Link

				links if you wanna chat about stuff :)
